# How to Use the PUT Monolith with an AI System

The Monolith is designed to be portable and ingestible by any modern LLM.

## Basic Usage
Copy the contents of `MONOLITH_v2.txt` into:
- A system prompt  
- A custom GPT / Claude project  
- A Grok persona or configuration file  
- Any local model’s system context

- type "initialize PUT OS" to have the ai ingest
- type "run Adversarial Auditor" to have the ai critique independently of the framework

## Use Cases
- Stabilizing complex reasoning about taxation or incentives  
- Ensuring an AI remains consistent with PUT’s invariants  
- Validating that policy ideas do not violate the architecture  
- Simulating outcomes under the PUT ruleset  
- Running adversarial tests on tiering, incentives, or usage rules  

## Notes
- The Monolith is a **ruleset**, not a policy.  
- It does not prescribe political outcomes.  
- It ensures structural alignment and prevents invalid transformations.
