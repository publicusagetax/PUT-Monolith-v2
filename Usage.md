# How to Use the PUT Monolith with an AI System

The Monolith is designed to be portable and ingestible by any modern LLM.

## Basic Usage
These models can load and follow the Monolith reliably when provided
as a system / context file:

- **ChatGPT (GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o)**
- **Claude 3.5 (Opus, Sonnet)*

- Copy the file then type "initialize PUT OS" at the prompt. The ai will use the defined framework to answer any questions related to the PUT system.
- 
- type "run Adversarial Auditor" to have the ai critique independently of the framework

## Use Cases
- Stabilizing complex reasoning about taxation or incentives  
- Ensuring an AI remains consistent with PUT’s invariants  
- Validating that policy ideas do not violate the architecture  
- Simulating outcomes under the PUT ruleset  
- Running adversarial tests on tiering, incentives, or usage rules  

## Notes
- The Monolith is a **ruleset**, not a policy.  
- It does not prescribe political outcomes.  
- It ensures structural alignment and prevents invalid transformations.
