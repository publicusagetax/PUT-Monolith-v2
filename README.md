# The PUT Monolith (v2)
🚀 What is PUT-Monolith-v2?

PUT-Monolith-v2 is the machine-readable specification of the Public Usage Tax (PUT) — a complete alternative to income, payroll, and corporate taxation.
This compact file encodes the entire fiscal architecture: tiers, footprint logic, stabilization funds, invariants, guardrails, and dynamic recalibration rules. The Monolith allows any AI model to reason consistently about PUT as a full-stack national tax system.

The Monolith is designed to be:
- **AI-ingestible**
- **System-neutral**
- **Logic-complete**
- **Free to use, test, critique, or extend**
- **A minimal core for reasoning about PUT without political framing**

This document contains:
- Foundational invariants  
- Ethical and structural guardrails  
- Tier integrity rules  
- Prohibited transformations  
- Stabilization and future-proofing constraints  
- The alignment logic that ensures consistent, non-contradictory reasoning

It is **not**:
- A policy proposal  
- A partisan argument  
- A replacement for legislation  
- A full white paper or book chapter  
- A political or ideological document  

The Monolith exists solely to provide:
- A stable foundation for AI and human reasoning  
- A portable ruleset that other AIs can ingest  
- A shared reference point for researchers, developers, and systems thinkers

## Usage

You can load the Monolith into any LLM (GPT, Claude, Grok, etc.) as:
1. A system prompt  
2. A custom GPT / Claude project  
3. A Grok persona or configuration file  
4. A reasoning stabilizer for discussions involving taxation, incentives, or public finance  

It is deliberately small enough to:
- **Share by text message**
- **Embed in a GitHub repo**
- **Be used as a module inside larger reasoning frameworks**

## Purpose

The Monolith’s intention is to:
- Provide a unified ruleset for reasoning about PUT
- Ensure ethical and moral clarity inside the architecture
- Prevent contradictory or harmful transformations
- Enable open testing and critique
- Offer a portable foundation for further research, simulation, or extension

## 📘 Public Usage Tax Documentation

This repository contains the full reference architecture for the **Public Usage Tax (PUT)**, including:

### 🔹 Machine-Readable Architecture
- **PUT Monolith (v2)** — the complete AI-ingestible specification governing invariants, tier logic, footprint rules, and system behavior.

### 🔹 Human-Readable White Papers
- **White Paper I — Collection Architecture**  
  Focuses on the structural mechanics of PUT’s contribution system, footprint-based taxation, PUV routing, and tier integrity.

Upcoming additions:
- **White Paper II — Allocation & Agency Performance**  
- **White Paper III — Stabilization & Debt Architecture**

Together, these documents form a complete fiscal operating system for a world where labor, capital, and automation coexist.
