# The PUT Monolith (v2)

A compact, self-contained architectural specification for the Public Usage Tax (PUT) system.

The Monolith is designed to be:
- **AI-ingestible**
- **System-neutral**
- **Logic-complete**
- **Free to use, test, critique, or extend**
- **A minimal core for reasoning about PUT without political framing**

This document contains:
- Foundational invariants  
- Ethical and structural guardrails  
- Tier integrity rules  
- Prohibited transformations  
- Stabilization and future-proofing constraints  
- The alignment logic that ensures consistent, non-contradictory reasoning

It is **not**:
- A policy proposal  
- A partisan argument  
- A replacement for legislation  
- A full white paper or book chapter  
- A political or ideological document  

The Monolith exists solely to provide:
- A stable foundation for AI and human reasoning  
- A portable ruleset that other AIs can ingest  
- A shared reference point for researchers, developers, and systems thinkers  

---

## Usage

You can load the Monolith into any LLM (GPT, Claude, Grok, etc.) as:
1. A system prompt  
2. A custom GPT / Claude project  
3. A Grok persona or configuration file  
4. A reasoning stabilizer for discussions involving taxation, incentives, or public finance  

It is deliberately small enough to:
- **Share by text message**
- **Embed in a GitHub repo**
- **Be used as a module inside larger reasoning frameworks**

## Purpose

The Monolith’s intention is to:
- Provide a unified ruleset for reasoning about PUT
- Ensure ethical and moral clarity inside the architecture
- Prevent contradictory or harmful transformations
- Enable open testing and critique
- Offer a portable foundation for further research, simulation, or extension
